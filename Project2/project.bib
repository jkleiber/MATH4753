abstract = {Two studies were conducted to examine the effects of implausible anchors on initial salary offers. Participants provided a salary offer to a candidate after receiving a relevant anchor and an implausible anchor. The results of Study 1 indicated that a high implausible anchor influenced salary offers, even in the presence of the relevant anchor. Study 2 examined whether a more extreme implausible anchor would also affect salary offers. The results indicated that both the high anchor and the extremely high anchor led to higher salary offers than did the control condition.},

abstract = "The article reviews theoretical analyses and some recent evidence on the role of reference points and anchors in individual choice, and considers possible implications of these analyses for a treatment of negotiation. Reference points are characterized by the abrupt changes in the valuation of gains and losses and of acceptable or reprehensible behavior. Norm theory is applied to the treatment of mixed feelings about outcomes to which multiple reference points are relevant. Anchoring effects in judgment are analyzed in terms of a memory process that assigns normality to possible values."
